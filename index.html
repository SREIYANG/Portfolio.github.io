<p>
    I'm a fourth year student of Bachelor of Nursing Science from Faculty of Nursing, Mahidol University. I can speak three languages such as Khmer(native), English and Thai. Currently I'm on the process of achieving my Nursing degree.
     My education in different subject areas, as well as my strong decision-making, problem-solving, and action-driven leadership skills combined with my training experiences, make me an excellent professional in the field I chose.
</p>
<p>In pursuing this education, my purpose is to help patient achieve their wellbeing and achieving their maximum potentials. 
    The years of experiences in hospital setting allowed me to possess a substantial background to keep my ambition alive and I found myself extremely interested in continuing my work as a nurse. I'm very excited about this coming year, I know I can face challenges because of the determination to achieve my goals and desired career. 
    That's fine, I do apprecite to pursue this ambition in the field of nursing. It is fun.
</p>
<p> There are many hobbies that I always keep doing unconciously. It's not unique, but it is not the same as what other people do.  
    I have no outsides interests, but I do love exploring new places.
    I like playing Valleyball, but I don't like playing game.
    I like drawing, but I don't like coloring the picture.
    I like singing, but I don't know how to sing.
    I like going to sleep early, but I don't know how to wake up early. This is a me! :)

    ideas, sharing of nursing expertise, socializing with international
    counterparts etc, in the meantime examine the its relevance to my career
    in the future.

Nursing Skills</div>
<p>
    Nursing is one of the most demanding careers to go into, but it's also one of the most 
    rewarding. It's also a career that's expected to see a lot of growth by 2026, which means more nursing jobs are expected to be created.
In addition to having solid health care skills, those who succeed in the 
nursing profession possess unique qualities of character and spirit.</p>

<p>Every profession need to have both soft and hard skills. Soft skills are personal attributes that are necessary 
    to succeed in any work environment, 
    including nursing. Hard skills of nursing are clinical competencies 
    essential to performing tasks, such as IV insertion, medication administration, and wound care. 
    These are what i can do:
